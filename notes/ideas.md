# ideas for equery

for future reference: implement functionalities via a quasi-command line interface (like command {equery statement})
for example, component {function call}
or calendar {function call} almost as a parent for parsing statements to understand the conformanlity of each type, making it more abstract

for building relatively opinionated libraries (such as the pseudo xml parser), we can keep it local for now, rather than turning it into an npm module

bluesky uses expo which is interesting, seems like a good platform for small teams to iterate quickly
